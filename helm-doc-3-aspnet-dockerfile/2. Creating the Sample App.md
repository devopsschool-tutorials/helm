# Creating the web API using the CLI

Create a folder in the location of your choice.

Navigate to that folder.

## Creating the application
To create a sample web api .NET core application using CLI, open VS Code and run the following:

```
$ dotnet new webapi -minimal -o TodoApi
$cd TodoApi
$code -r ../TodoApi`
```

To build the newly created application run the following command:

`$ dotnet build`

## Running the application

Trust the HTTPS development certificate by running the following command:

`$ dotnet dev-certs https --trust`

And let's run the application:

`$ dotnet run`

## Testing the setup

Check the output after you run the above command:
Example:
